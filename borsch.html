            Borsch is one of the most famous dishes in Ukrainian cuisine, known for its vibrant red color and rich flavor. 
            The origins of this beloved soup trace back centuries, where it was prepared as a staple in rural Ukrainian households. 
            Traditionally, borsch is made with beetroot, giving it the distinct color, and can vary in ingredients depending on the 
            region and family recipe. It has become a symbol of Ukrainian identity, often served with sour cream and accompanied 
            by garlic bread known as <strong>pampushky</strong>.
